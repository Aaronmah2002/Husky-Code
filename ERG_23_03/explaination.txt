when using the latest controller 
the error is still the problem of defintion of the matrix E. Then of using the controller from the forst semmester --> working nicely 



when using the declareperiodicevent in the initialization of the erg at a frequency of 100Hz the error appears to be; 

"File "/home/aaron/drake_brubotics/tutorials/python_tutorials/erg_1.py", line 134, in refrence
    output.SetFromVector(self.q_v_)
AttributeError: 'pydrake.systems.framework.DiscreteValues' object has no attribute 'SetFromVector'"
